# Energy-Consumption-Forecasting-South-North-Carolina

eSC, an energy company serving residential properties primarily in South Carolina with a 
smaller portion in North Carolina, is concerned about the impact of global warming on the 
electricity demand. With the looming threat of blackouts during peak summer months, 
particularly in July, eSC aims to mitigate this risk by understanding the key drivers of energy 
usage and promoting energy-saving practices among its customers. Rather than investing in 
additional energy production facilities, eSC seeks to reduce energy consumption during periods 
of high demand, thereby ensuring grid stability and environmental sustainability. By 
incentivizing customers to save energy, eSC aims to meet demand without compromising service 
reliability or exacerbating environmental impacts.
